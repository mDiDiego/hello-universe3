# hello-universe3
This is my Git writing
Change option color for text as black foreground
# made background light gray
the tic-toc-toe line is always yellow??
Why??
Now, back remote on GitHub
and added this line
So my repository is in GitHub not Git Bash (local)
Now on Nov. 27, 2021, I am making another change .
I made the the change by adding the line above.
# 
lokks line the tic-toc-symbol is a line break.
